## Coaching advice
### Skill
1) Chris was my coach for this quarter. He worked with me to develop a workable series of goals and stayed in touch with me to ensure I was both getting the support I needed from the team and following through on my part in those goals. Awesome stuff.
2) Very effective
3) I wish I had more support from you this quarter in managing some of the risks we are facing with Elephant
4) Chris stays on top of a lot of different initiatives, pushing them forward at critical moments.  He also is able to take strategic perspectives on initiatives which is an incredibly useful skill to tap into.
5) I really liked the changes made to the coaching process. Having us create issues in github and manage against them was a great idea. I have found your feedback as a coach to be very valuable.
### Productivity
1) You didn't let off the pedal this quarter.  We can't have that push every quarter, but I think it was good for the team.
2) Chris balances driving individuals and the team with managing the business expectations.
### Reliability
1) Helpful
2) Chris is generally reliable. Sometimes Rat Thing isn't though.
3) Thank you for your support in attending our weekly board grooming calls.  Your presence is important to the entire team.
### Contribution
1) he steps in contributes in unexpected ways always. It will be interesting exercise for you to step out of your current role and try some other role
2) I think the major contribution Chris made this quarter is to step back from Rat Thing and find other keepers.  I have no doubt this was difficult.  But given his divided attention, making sure that the next generation of Rat Thing would be taken care of by a couple of our teams' best programmers is, in the end, a laudable contribution.
3) Our coaching practices changed this quarter with focus on quarterly goals.  This was the largest benefit to the team.
