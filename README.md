## Coaching advice
### Skill
1) Chris is always looking out for the team, keeping us aligned with the business, and being the broader-organization-facing primary point of contact. There's no one on the team I would rather see filling this purpose.
2) You started the quarter with some very risky decisions. It appeared that the stress of the situation was challenging.  Some of slowly disappeared over the quarter, but making decisions on topics you are not fully versed in can appear risky even if you end up being successful in the gamble.  Gamble less.
3) Wow.  What a quarter. Letting others lead was the theme of this quarter and Chris really challenged others to share in pushing things forward. It made for a much better FRONT.
4) Awesome work with Rat Thing and coaching bot. Coaching bot is really cool and automated
5) Of course good commanding skills which makes the team to be always proactive.
6) Chris is constantly keeping us focused on creating business value and on making sure that stakeholders outside our group are excited for the project and see the value that it is creating.  Obviously, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to join this team without that.
7) Very effective
8) Chris was slightly pushy in delivering on our projects, but not overly so.  Additionally, Chris added to Rat Thing capabilities to facilitate visibility of progress for the team
9) As my coach this quarter Chris greatly exapnded my knowledge and understanding as to how to best function in a networked, remote team
10) Chris's work on rat thing using python is just awesome 
### Productivity
1) Rat Thing made improvements consistently across the quarter.  Other forms of momentum that were generated were less healthy. 
2) Chris has consistently prodded me to keep delivering value.
3) It's possible to be too productive. I suggest reducing the number of meetings attended (if you can) or ensuring that you don't have multiple issues that are low priority occupying your time. Stay healthy!
4) high productivity
5) Chris did an amazing amount of work. He pushed some code out and probably saved a lot of time overall in the review process for everyone.
6) Clearly the manner in which I am filing this very report is indicative of Chris' productivity.  He is, in fact, so productive that he develops in production! ;)
7) Highly productive. Made team's life simpler with bots
8) Rat Thing, NexGen, patent - 'nuff said
9) He always tries to help in our issues to move further as a coach.
### Reliability
1) Chris facilitated meetings on a regular basis and always delivered his results on time
2) Chris has always kept me aware of his availability for meetings and let's me know when he can't make it, which is always helpful.
3) highly reliable
4) Omnipresent.
5) always
6) Highly reliable. Keeps following through commitments.
7) Expectation management was a challenge for you this quarter.  Everything else was ok
8) Chris is mostly reliable, but this quarter he was spread a bit thin and missed a few meeting.  Small chink in the armor.
9) My issue will be solved quickly if I reach out to him.
### Contribution
1) Chris took all of the coaching app's beta reviewer's comments and really improved it quickly - that was a great example of using iterations to deliver value.
2) This feedback is split into awesome and horrible. Although I do want to help Chris migrate Rat Thing to something not-Python in the next quarter, I can't deny the concrete value I'm getting from the templating alone. The coach command is an awesome contribution. On the other side, we actively weakened a portion of our culture this past quarter when Chris decided that the team made a decision that was not, in fact, a team decision. A suggestion I have to improve this process is to recognize when we are making a decision as a team and when someone is making a decision alone - our team culture bakes in the ability to respect that decision (and people who do not respect that decision should certainly be taken to task). Trust the process.
3) No doubt in it.
4) Chris's contribution on rat thing is significant, it has greatly improved our work efficiency, constantly reminding us of assigned issues and other responsibilities like PR
5) Contributed to making processes and tasks very simple with automated bots
6) Rocked it
7) he steps in contributes in unexpected ways always
8) Your work with the deployments of model office were critical to our quarter's success.  
9) Chris seemed very focused on perceived progress towards beta-ready, rather than concrete and lasting progress. The movement of issues seemed more important than the creation of technical debt. Since I've been on this team we've never missed a milestone, but we've also made very little real progress. This quarter it does seem that we've made real progress but almost by chance.
