## Coaching advice
### Skill
1) From a technical standpoint, the technical skills for Chris were proven this quarter.  His architecture for Hiro v2 has gained lots of traction and is hitting its stride of being proven out.  That said, there were other aspects which could've gone better.  The Hiro initiative was split into essentially three teams with overlapping resources.  This caused a great strain on our ability to deliver on MBIs.  Additionally, we all agreed that "keeping the lights" on were priority during this experiment.  That commitment was not followed through upon.  In the future, we need to be deliberate on resources and follow through on commitments even when they may slowdown progress on other fronts.
2) Very effective at almost everything he does. Suggestion: May need to spend some time understanding various processes in other parts of the organisation
3) Chris is respectful of team members and communicates company changes in an effective and timely manner.  Chris genuinely wants to support the process of learning to help others develop.  He does not allow preconceived ideas of the likely outcomes to influence his commitment to encouraging and guiding others to stretch themselves to grow professionally.
4) I worked with you over the last month and I were completely satisfied with your knowledgeable skill sets on GitHub, that I learned a lot from you.
5) Chris had very good communication skills this quarter, and they showed during his work within the team.

However, he introduced a large quantity of risk at a possibly dangerous time.  This seems to have happened while there was confusion within the hiro team about the causes of the existing v1 risk, which further compounded the risk involved.  Everyone on that team leaped at a chance to get past the challenges that v1 was providing.  This largely appears to have been due to exhaustion with the existing codebase rather than any actual technical reason.

It seemed like there was a heroic amount of effort involved in mitigating the risk that terminating hiro v1 created.  Chris provided a lot of that work personally. For practical definitions, however, the v2 architecture effort proceeded as unplanned work that was a result of an emotional decision rather than a technical one.
6) There is no question that you are very skilled in your area and are very persistent and dedicated to taking care of everyone and that you are truly invested in the tools we use (like pepper, coachbot) and enhancing and gaining increased buy-in for processes surrounding them.  This is very valuable moving forward.  I think that for the most part you have been great in helping us mature as a team in our board meetings.  Sometimes your communication can be curt or abrasive or maybe done without full understanding of the issue/question.  For example, at one point I asked an innocent question which seemed to result in a couple of levels of indirect reprimand (surrounding slack) which was disconcerting and embarrassing.  Really, I greatly admire you and the sheer amount that you juggle in your position, so most of me rationalizes on your behalf that you may not have time to provide thoughtful responses at every given moment. Also big thumbs up on your general responsiveness not only to me but to everyone (it is objectively apparent on the open slack channels, at all hours)
7) You demonstrated excellent coaching skills because 1) you draw on tremendous skills and experience; 2) you believe in the ability for people to improve; 3) you care about their doing so.

You should continue to relate your "players" experiences/issues to your own & other team members. It showed we're all fighting bad behaviors and that change is possible.
8) Situation/Task: Prototyping Hiro V2
Action: You took the mantle to demo how this could work.
Result: We worked off the bones you setup and successfully matched V1 parity.
             You are our GOTO Python and TF dude.
9) Chris Creel demonstrated skills regarding team building
10) Your management of delivery risk concerns me this quarter. You have adhered to the MBI process, and ensured work is aligned with an MBI (or admitting an MBI failure and pivoting in anticipation of the coming quarter[s]). When you are told about a delivery risk -- such as credentialing or testability -- your reaction has been to dismiss the person mentioning that risk and ignore the problem. You can develop the ability to assess delivery risk. I do see hope in that you are bringing on additional resources to review your code and reduce your lone-wolfness. Please ensure all code you write in the coming quarters goes through a PR process of at least one other developer, and has testing applied. Per each delivery risk assessment you receive from a teammate, create an issue stating the perceived risk and give yourself the opportunity to develop a mitigation strategy or have a longer-term conversation where you can postmortem that assessment.
### Productivity
1) Chris shares a broader vision to help others to see the complete picture rather than just one aspect of it to help others better understand the value.
2) - I am totally satisfied with Chris' productivity
- Cleanfuel patent application has been submitted, there is a disclosure for a new patent application, metaverse paper has been submitted to Nord with feedback incorporated from others, coach bot and pepper have new useful features added. There are some of the few things I know of many things Chris has produced this quarter
3) Chris accomplished a lot in this quarter. The work in expanding our network was very positive. He pushed another patent through as well.
4) The new Hiro architecture was initially sold into the team in an entirely unusable state.  Moving toward it was noted as a lower cost than it turned out to be, in keeping with the expected amount of overconfidence and understatement of risk that Chris usually provides. 

Chris seems to be affected from an application the Pareto principle, where 80% of the result comes from 20% of the effort.  That last 20% of the work, which tends to require 80% of the effort, is where he loses momentum.  

Advice for this quarter is to continue to think creatively but stop selling results early.
5) Wonderful as always.
6) Situation/Task: Dynamic Policy loader
Action: You implement this in Python.
Result: We are able to dynamically deploy policies without re-deploying the entire infrastructure.
7) Chris cranks at an unbelievable level by being on all the time.  He was able to see Hiro v2 come to life, deliver on his Metaverse paper, and progress the position of Labs through the acquisition.  I recommend to just watch the amount of time spent and impact on personal life. 
8) The globe traveling leader of Labs still found time this quarter to code like a fresh college grad swimming in stock options and ramen circa 2000.  Truly an impressive feat.
9) You practice what you preach which sets an excellent example throughout the organization. As the leader (of a flat organization) it is apparent you are part of the team and not lording over it.
10) I were very satisfied with your productivity over the last quarter. Together you helped me and my team to be able to have the integration test done successfully before delivering the product to Production.
11) You absolutely do well here... you are instrumental in getting people to stay on track, consider various strategies for accomplishing goals, always working to help unblock and enabling our team to keep forward progress whenever it is something that falls into your purview.
12) I've seen you deliver items in the bot space without having full transparency into the process. I was pleased with your coaching in the area of interpersonal communication between team members; you were able to give me some communication strategies I found effective. Focus on keeping that positivity in the fourth quarter and reduce dependency on yourself by bringing in additional team members to your codebases.
### Reliability
1) I were very satisfied with you on your reliability over the last quarter. Any tasks that we assigned to you, or asked you for help would be guarantee to be done very quickly and correctly.
2) Chris is the model example of reliability as he understands that it represents commitments to others.
3) Whether it be making a connection or sharing information, Chris follows through on his commitments and offers suggestions in a timely manner.
4) Chris made some decisions regarding platform and technology. We had a goal of operating our current HIRO v1, which was not accomplished. We should take care in predicting outcomes or committing to operational support in the future.
5) This was the most reliable that Chris Creel has been.  At no point this quarter did he miss a meeting that did not get rescheduled.  He kept on point for all of his commitments.  

6) The feature feedback cycle you bring to the team -- changes in our practices, updates to coach bot and pepper -- are done well. You correctly solicit feedback from the team on these changes prior to implementation. You can level up your stewardship of those projects in the quality space by introducing team members to your code and submerging yourself into that part of the feedback cycle. Up to this point you have held people at arm's length from those codebases; I believe this may be from an internalized fear. Perhaps you are worried that people will be harsh or critical of your code. Like cold water, you can handle this in two ways: Jump in all at once, or take slow steps. The important thing is that by the end of Q4 I want to see evidence that you've entered the water (if you'll forgive the rather torturous metaphor).
7) During the first two months of the quarter, we met weekly for coaching sessions. Your attention to my issues/behavior improvement was high.

It tailed off some toward the end of the quarter when our last scheduled coaching session was cancelled and the remainder of the quarter was not scheduled. You can set better expectations as the quarter winds down for closing out issues and scheduled sessions.
8) You rarely keep people waiting for too long whenever you have committed to doing something.  you are at something like 97-98% so I am still completely satisfied!!!!   I appreciate as well that when you are stuck or there is need for clarification you are quick to reach out to get additional understanding and to make suggestions when the path forward isn't clear.
### Contribution
1) I believe that your driving passion is to empower teammates and to create the best culture that you can envision - at least this is what I see in 100 different things that you do and say.  Because it is your passion it might practically be impossible for me to say that I am anything less than completely satisfied.  You do what you expect others to do, you lead the way you expect others to lead, and in these examples you are continually building up not only individuals but the teams as well.  
2) Hiro 2 architecture was a splendid effort. Other efforts to expand coaching team or refine the MBI process are very useful
3) Chris strengthens team members by helping them align to work that they find meaningful and interesting.
4) You have a tendency to celebrate early. When you celebrate prior to a delivery, you may communicate to a solution owner or people who are watching that the race is run when in reality a hurdle was cleared. That is still cause for celebration! Please consider using a more nuanced HOORAY when following along as an observer in the troubleshooting and delivery process. Alternatively, you may cultivate a trusted per-solution team member known only to you who will provide the appropriate time to shout unqualified HOORAYs. If you would like to continue writing Python I would request that you sign on for the python support initiative. What follows this sentence is feedback I am providing to multiple people this quarter, and is not indicative of failure but something I'd like to see in future quarters: Rather than test code on your own machine or with your own devices, partner with at least one DevOps team member to get a self-service environment in AWS you can use that matches the deployment environment closely. Speed matters, and the fastest speed is achieved by unifying the environment at the beginning of development rather than the end.
5) Chris contributes focuses on pushing the team forward as usual.  The only thing that I recommend is that Chris reflects on triggers of stress from this past quarter with regards to Hiro v2, and find ways to manage it in a way that does not hit the team.  There were a couple incidents of demotivating behaviors impacting the team.
6) Chris provided a number of empowering elements to our team and to the spread of culture through Cotiviti.  He enabled the hiro team to detach themselves from what had become a difficult situation to understand.  He pushed forward a Cotiviti cloud strategy that is likely the only strategy the company will ever have.
7) The contribution was strong in trying to move to AWS.  Who knew we would be bought and that would be challenged. I love the AWS strategy.
8) - Chris always looks for opportunities to empower others on the team.
- Chris presented the processes with issue management using pepper at a Slack conference. That just took Labs team to a whole new level. Certain other parts of the world now knows about Labs team and how we do things
- Other parts of the company now are trying to follow our culture, this reinforces our existing culture and we are now getting feedback from others which can only improve it
- Chris contributed to various hiro lambda architecture discussions this quarter , always emphasizing on sticking to the ground rules and not over complicating it
9) Over the last month, you helped us to setup and configure the Github Repos and branches that gave us more confident to take on other challenge tasks.
10) Your action oriented tendencies make the team better. In board meetings you practice decisiveness whether supporting a team member's issue or your own. You "do" for all to see while the meeting is happening.

   * Almost all conversations were effortless.
   * Performance improved a little.
   * Conversations occured daily.
   * Your comments were somewhat positive and were somewhat subjective

## Social advice
### Energy
1) The same energy that allows blazing a coding trail towards a new architecture also torches team members if not carefully controlled. We are all progressing towards the same goal, and no one deserves to be burnt in that righteous pursuit.
2) Our interactions were very good this quarter. 
3) Chris communicates very succinctly.  Meetings stay on task, cover the planned agenda and end on time.  Chris provides a motivating but honest outlook that does not feel phony.  
4) You are full of energy and I enjoy working with you.
5) Sometimes I am a little apprehensive talking to you because I don't know when it might go sideways - I feel as though I generally try to think things through first and if I am stuck and ask a question I want to feel safe doing so.  I don't mind being wrong or corrected (i would rather that than continue in error always), it is more that I prefer it to be done in a way that is not condescending or humiliating in front of a bunch of people. I try to be tough but the bottom line is that I won't contribute where I don't feel psychologically safe. That is the most important value which I hold dear.  Most of the time it is fine - but there have been a few times where there was an "ouch..."
6) I enjoy talking with you, and always come away with plenty of food for thought.
7) Keep enabling a fun, productive & safe environment. 
8) Solid on energy in my interactions with him.
### Improvement
1) Chris was able to let go of code he wrote.  Being somebody who has been in a similar position and given Chris's position in the team, this was difficult, but it helped the overall velocity and ownership of the team, and seemed to energize Chris as the dynamic changed.
2) With almost 2 quarters of working with you (however tangentially) under my belt you are still someone who is always trying to help develop my skills and you have a lot to offer. This is a funny question because if you were already great at something it is difficult to improve.  Its probably easier to get worse - which you didn't in my opinion
3) I want to see unification of the feedback cycle you bring to new features into the space around your code. This is your largest area for improvement. The second largest is auto-accepting delivery risks, documenting them in issues, and confronting them head-on at the appropriate phase of development.
4) It would be interesting to explore new initiatives to work upon while focusing on delivery on the current initiatives. That balance may be needed for the team. 
### Frequency
1) I think we have a healthy level of contact frequency based on the needs of the team and our respective spheres of responsibility.  I think that it would be great to be coached by you, which would necessitate some additional time but still on the level of several times per week.  The best way to move the Mostly Satisfieds to Completely Satisfieds is for me to just talk to you more and hear from you more!  (I used to get migraines driving into Boston, until I had to travel by myself all over the place and drive and navigate big cities...there is no way to not conquer the anxiety if you are immersed in the situation and become adapted to it!)
2) You are possibly _too_ available. Consider this a friendly reminder to take time to recharge. I didn't see as much of you going AFK to run or get away from the screen this quarter.
3) We met a little less this quarter with each other.  Would like to meet more.
4) We interacted each other frequently via Slack. This helped us to move the tasks/issue quickly even though we were in different time zones.
