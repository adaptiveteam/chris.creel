## Coaching advice
### Skill
1) Chris did great as a coach for the team with recommending the book for the quarter and pressing on MBIs.  This next quarter, I'd like to see Chris align better with the monitoring of MBIs.  He seemed surprised at the end of the quarter.
2) I'm satisfied with Chris' work with paperwork and the executive team, but I'd like to see him partner with a DevOps team member next quarter to consider continuous reliable delivery of future bot solutions.
3) - As a coach, Chris ensured that we always focused on getting business value out of the work we did. This helped us prioritize the issues better and start working on the ones that provided business value with least risk
- Chris helped us properly analyzing the risk and prioritize the issues accordingly. He always insisted on providing update on the MBIs in all hands calls. Chris also enabled Pepper to pester the issue creators if they don't have priority and risk specified
- Chris also created channels specifically to broadcast updates to the team so we don't miss them with our work
4) his teaming effort and communicating to the right person to finish of the things are amazing
5) I thought your terraform code for the coach bot automation was both ambitious and well implemented.
6) Chris stepped up in a big way this quarter, with helping us find better focus through MBIs. We are a well-meaning group that can get distracted by wanting to solve too many problems at once. Having the MBIs broken down into specific tasks, and getting people to be on point for them, really made this quarter more successful. It helped all of us in focusing and prioritizing our work.
7) Chris Creel is good at interacting with people outside of the team. 
8) Chris Learnt Lambda and various technologies around it, and we are all using Pepper for everyday work, it's just great.
He is always trying to learn new languages whether its Hindi, Russian, Swiss , Chinese  and he should get credit for this as well because it eases the tense environment and helps to bond better when you have a team across the globe.
9) Chris has solid skills as a team coach and mentor.
10) Chris is obviously working hard on building alliances for the team and raising our team's value to the company as a whole.  I'm glad we're moving in this direction and I hope this work continues.
### Productivity
1) - Pepper is better than ever. Bugs have been addressed with this and now there are terraform scripts to deploy Pepper automatically
- Coach bot has been upgraded to help accelerate team members provide more effective feedback in a faster way. S3 forms was an awesome feature
2) Chris helped me bring a result about several times.  Mostly his efforts were just parallel to my own, and that helped.
3) Chris brought the team to Atlanta to kick off the elephantv2 initiative, and I'm pleased with this. His overall strategic planning this quarter made enormous improvements.
4) Chris was very supportive and also very productive. He reworked several tools and processes, pushed on the patents and even attended leadership!
5) Chris influences us all in ways to increase our productivity.  However, over the next quarter, I hope that Chris will manage his expectations better about how quickly the team to produce results.
6) Chris pushed on MBIs, coaching, and aligning Labs with Digital.  He gave it his all all quarter.  In these exercises, it seemed like Chris was taking a lot on his own shoulders and it seemed to his stress points with him.  Spread the responsibilities.
7) mostly he is able to throw in right resources and provide valuable inputs to produce desired result
8) Chris never wastes time, he is very productive and it's also because he is exactly doing the things that he loves to do.
### Reliability
1) Chris was on time with all coaching meetings.  I appreciated the effort and time put aside for these discussions
2) Chris followed through on his commitments to me, but I'm never certain he will take the time to communicate dependencies to internal team members reliably. In future quarters I'd like to see (during meetings) Chris ask a team member to update the team on a dependent or future-work piece rather than the 'it's just' hand-wave.
3) Chris followed through with our commitments for the quarter very effectively
4) Chris was very reliable in driving delivery. 
5) - Chris follows up with all the commitments. He was always available to talk about literally anything
- He took feedback from users about pepper and coach bots and quickly incorporated them
6) I love Chris' enthusiasm, but his excitement sometimes causes him to speak (or celebrate) too soon. He should think about holding back a bit in what he communicates and when. Staying focused on the messaging around MBIs and just delivering on those, will keep us out of over-promising.  
7) Chris not only followed through on his own commitments but also stayed very close to the MBI process and made sure the team could hit those targets.
8) very few or rare instances when did not hear back from him
9) Very Reliable, he is the driving force behind all the good work that we do.
### Contribution
1) Chris pushed hard to engage digital team. He works tirelessly to maintain coach bot and other tools to helps the team stay on top of their game.
2) I can't overstate Chris' work this quarter on enforcing our team culture. Awesome!
3) This was a big learning quarter around MBIs. Chris always stepped in where MBIs were in danger to offer contributions to push back on track.
4) many times he follows up tirelessly outside the team to get something done that's blocking things  
5) The entire team has a positive energy.  I attribute this to two things: the book for the entire team and stability of team changes on initiatives.  I recommend looking for similar opportunities each quarter.
6) I love the time Chris takes to develop new tools for the team, like Coach Bot, the agenda features for meetings, and RAT THING (which should always be known as RAT THING, dammit). He has a very unique skill set in this regard. These are tools that make managing and prioritizing daily work easier and just less boring and gross. I don't know of any solutions outside of Labs that exist for these services. They should be shared with the universe, and the universe will declare them as awesome.
7) - Chris is always there to empower other team members. If he sees that someone is needs help, he asks for others if we can help them. With new team members, Chris ensures that they have what they need and redirects them to appropriate person
- Chris has always reinforced our culture, which is now being embraced by other parts of the company
- He ensures we have documentation around the processes and practices and we now have moodle courses to help others get familiar with our culture

## Social advice
### Energy
1) Many challenges this quarter. I think Chris handled them pretty well. Despite some very challenging feedback, he pushed don and kept his energy high. 
2) Conversations with Chris are always energizing. Except once in a while before he has a meeting with suits .
3) It can be challenging to determine what and why of our direction.  The MBI process seems to be an improvement over previous tries, but it remains to be seen if there will be any significant change internally or with the rest of the organization.
4) There are unconfirmed reports that Chris drank a cup of coffee this quarter, and the resulting energy was enough to power a small city.
5) Chris has great energy levels, I always feel energized after talking to him. He is one person who made me believe in myself when i was going through a really tough phase in my life. He did not give up on me, I was about to ruin my career but his faith and belief in me brought me back. You transformed me Chris. I will always be grateful to you all my life. I wish there were more people like you and you are not arrogant and I don't know who thinks that way, you are one of the most kind person I have ever met. 
### Improvement
1) Much improvement this quarter spread through my other comments, but I wanted to especially call-out the 'let's do it the boring way' attitude he brought to elephantv2. That's a monumental improvement, and I do not use that imagery lightly. Excellent!
### Frequency
1) We talk few times a week and as in required
2) I spoke with Chris on a fairly frequent basis this quarter.
3) Chris, a great thank you for the team and the culture that you have built, its amazing how we feel motivated to do some thing every day. This global team thing is very useful;  we usually don't have a huge team sitting around us hence less distractions and more focus on our work and zoom is great for collaboration. Thank you for not making logistics a huge issue as it is in most other companies.  Last but not the least thankyou for Pepper :)
4) We fell short on our frequency but finished strong.
