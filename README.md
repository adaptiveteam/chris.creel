## Coaching advice
### Skill
1) Highly skilled.
2) Chris seemed to become self aware this quarter for along period than usual. He has  
3) My evaluation is based on teaming and communication skills, which were very positive. Chris was very effective at helping the Merox team set priorities and keep the project moving.
4) Every quarter, I get a stronger sense both the various ways that Chris challenges our team to push us towards world class solutions (and how I can better respond to those challenges) and how he builds credibility for our team with the rest of the company.  During the face to face, Chris utilized the sessions he could be present for to help us bond and grow as a team.
5) Chris continues to be my 2nd most efficient adviser relative to candor of delivery.  I find a notable uptick in my quarterly scores after having Chris as a coach. 
6) Chris has the required skill to take our team in a direction that will lead to better results and more value for everyone.He has the skill to get the work done, he has the skill to understand the various cultures people are coming from and how
it effects the way they do work or socialise, he is one of the most skilled coaches. 
7) Chris did a great job this quarter on aligning the executive team, getting a second patent through the pipeline, helping general press around Labs, and driving our on-site.  Coaching feedback from last quarter could've been more constructive.
### Productivity
1) On the Jarvis project and as my coach I feel Chris was very productive.
2) Chris has a broad impact on productivity. He can affect peoples confidence in ways that make them stall or overthink things. this quarter he left a couple of people wondering what they should do next. The need to please the boss and do what is productive overall is quite challenging for some and may lead to wasted effort or unnecessary stress.
3) Chris helped me to better understand the steps in keeping the project moving.
4) Focussed on the results.
5) He is very productive. He overlooks all the projects 
### Reliability
1) From my perspective, clearly set expectations and led the team in keeping commitments to complete tasks in a timely fashion.
2) Highly reliable.
3) Though always timely, Chris was a bit murky when scheduling recurring weekly coaching appointments.  The dates and times seemed to shift w/o notification.
4) Chris was pretty reliable this quarter.
### Contribution
1) Pro active, looks for opportunities to contribute.
2) A side step from the Elephant project seemed appropriate at the time, as did the eventual hard reset of the project.  That said, I feel the aforementioned executive type decisions could have been made sooner in the quarter.
3) In general a good quarter; however, there was one event of using positional power.  This was an outlier, but impacted the team.
4) Sometimes I am not quite certain I'm getting Chris's full opinions about the state of various projects. I get the feeling that Chris is disappointed with both Merox and Elephant - evidenced not the least by the fact that we are taking a new direction with both.  If Chris is really disappointed by what we've done, I'd really appreciate getting a fuller sense of the sources of that disappointment.
5) I was disappointed in the personal influence on Elephant sunset. It was a cleansing fire, but could have been positioned differently with a separation of concerns.
6) His contribution towards the team is marvelous. 
7) Chris contributed to the Merox team primarily by leading in enforcing the teams standards and processes.

## Social advice
### Energy
1) Meetings were highly efficient, with no wasted time. I have no hesitation in interacting with Chris. In person interactions are inspiring due to the passion and optimism he brings to the discussion.
2) Great energy levels, He understands the various roadblocks and tries to find a way to cross them.
3) Had highly productive conversations

5) Energy was positive this quarter. 
### Results
1) Conversations have been focussed on results.
2) Our face to face was a great experience, thanks to Chris's organization and his generosity.  And I believe Chris did an excellent job this quarter of raising the profile of our team in a positive way with the rest of the company.
3) We as a team need better results. Individually, Chris did pretty well with the second patent, but I would challenge us to get others cooking rather. Results of others were overall less than I would hope for
4) I have continued to learn from my interactions with Chris and the team. When it became obvious that the Merox project had disappointing participation in the beta testing, I would like to have seen more discussion about possible causes and possible interventions or solutions.
5) Keep pushing with getting us over the line with our clients and in front of executives this next quarter.  We need to solidify our future in the company.
6) I learnt from Chris that whatever you have done whether its simple or complex, show it, give its demo, so that first thing others know what you are working on and you start getting feedbacks soon.

Chris for identifying the right coaches
