## Coaching advice
### Skill
1) Chris was my coach for this quarter. He worked with me to develop a workable series of goals and stayed in touch with me to ensure I was both getting the support I needed from the team and following through on my part in those goals. Awesome stuff.
2) Very effective
3) I wish I had more support from you this quarter in managing some of the risks we are facing with Elephant
4) Chris stays on top of a lot of different initiatives, pushing them forward at critical moments.  He also is able to take strategic perspectives on initiatives which is an incredibly useful skill to tap into.
5) I really liked the changes made to the coaching process. Having us create issues in github and manage against them was a great idea. I have found your feedback as a coach to be very valuable.
6) 5 is hte simplest way to put it
7) Chris has unique skills in positioning ideas and driving conversation. Note that these can be used for 'evil' although they typically are not. 
8) This was a good quarter especially from the perspective of pivoting our team with coaching and evolving.  Additionally, you did well in increasing our presence in the company.
### Productivity
1) You didn't let off the pedal this quarter.  We can't have that push every quarter, but I think it was good for the team.
2) Chris balances driving individuals and the team with managing the business expectations.
3) Chris gets a lot done, and what he does accomplish oftentimes has to be carried out in the forum most resistant to any kind of action - meetings.  He is constantly speaking up for us as a team and finding ways to translate those successes we have to patterns the rest of the company can emulate.
4) Every day I see a new way Chris is pushing to help either our team or the company at large
5) Chris is highly productive and works extremely hard. He has a lot going and manages interactions with executives to boot. 
6) Chris's facilitation of the weekly meetings has had counterproductive results of late. It is not uncommon for us to radically change the priority of issues on a week to week basis. This is disruptive to the teams understanding of what the goals are, and thus to our ability to effectively execute on those goals.
### Reliability
1) Helpful
2) Chris is generally reliable. Sometimes Rat Thing isn't though.
3) Thank you for your support in attending our weekly board grooming calls.  Your presence is important to the entire team.
4) always
5) You pushed for timeliness and made other accountable for it as well.
6) Anytime I needed something important, I could get it from Chris. Less important things might take time, but it is understandable when there's so much going on
7) Omnipresent.
### Contribution
1) he steps in contributes in unexpected ways always. It will be interesting exercise for you to step out of your current role and try some other role
2) I think the major contribution Chris made this quarter is to step back from Rat Thing and find other keepers.  I have no doubt this was difficult.  But given his divided attention, making sure that the next generation of Rat Thing would be taken care of by a couple of our teams' best programmers is, in the end, a laudable contribution.
3) Our coaching practices changed this quarter with focus on quarterly goals.  This was the largest benefit to the team.
4) The major contribution I was looking for from Chris this quarter was to facilitate the effective taking of action on the items that came up in the Atlanta architecture meeting. The only item for which this succeeded was Kafka, but many other items came up in that meeting.
5) Chris keeps us working, and blasts obstacles out of the way. Without his reminders on coaching goals, I wouldn't have completed some of the personal growth this quarter
6) Chris really stepped up this quarter to drive meaningful team decisions -- in some cases, by delegation. He enforced decisions when necessary, and I appreciate that.
7) Chris brings value in our culture although empowerment of others can be biased. He continues to ignore or miss the impact of positional power. It can activate the pleaser in some and can cause challenges with independent thinking of some.

## Social advice
### Energy
1) Chris continues insist that the manner in which we use github line up with his design of rat-thing. This continues to be a difficult spot for me. I now create separate offline lists and tracking mechanisms for items I'd normally just track in github, but if I do so now I will get questioned about daily.
2) I understand that you are really busy, but I would encourage you to have ongoing and open communication with solution owners, especially when you sign them up for stuff:)
3) Very energetic for the the aspects of work, specially as coach
4) Your energy was high all quarter and you seemed to manage stress well with what was clear managing that DMZ between our team and others
5) I'm still worried about Chris' time AFK (or lack thereof). I see him go running sometimes so am hopeful.
6) Chris is easy to talk to. I feel like there is a lot on his mind, because I would sometimes hear the same thing on multiple calls, or have to remind abotu a previous conversation
7) Conversations with Chris one on one are pretty productive. He is a good listener, enthusiastic about change, and always trying to predict. In group settings, his agenda can mute others input on occasion.
8) You are always looking for incremental, innovative ways to make us a better team. I really appreciate all of your energy and the time you give to Rat Thing, Coach Bot, (and likely many other things behind the scenes). They really make a difference in how we work and communicate.
9) Chris keeps conversations on track and productive, while giving everyone the space to speak.
### Results
1) Repeating: Chris' unique perspective and willingness to share knowledge give me frequent insight into the business goals and help keep alignment.
2) Interactions are fruitful
3) Conversations always had useful outcomes, but they were often focused on 6-12 months into the future even when asking about the near-term
4) Chris suggested that Watson create a new CotivitiService implementation in an attempt to solve problems brought up in Atlanta. This decision was based on a misunderstanding of the issues and led to several developers spending much of the quarter working on a new project which didn't solve any existing problems. Making matters worse, at the end of the quarter the new project which was supposed to make things easier and better isn't even feature complete enough to be used. As one of Chris's primary roles is facilitator, this was a major failing.
5) I would like to see more focus on doing what we are supposed to do (or rather what we have promised) than doing new stuff. I was very happy with progress and focus on clean fuel work. I was disdisappointed with the latency in integrating the disparate parts.
6) Chris's efforts have created this unique team space - surely the most unique collaborative space I have been part of in the whole of my career.  His ability to maintain this kind of environment in the face of challenges is something deeply admirable.
7) This was a highly productive quarter for you and was shown in the team.
### Frequency
1) I'm only occasionally waiting on Chris.
2) Chris and I managed to connect regularly and the frequency was pretty good.
3) I spoke with Chris at least once a week
