## Coaching advice
### Skill
1) Creel is on the critical path between the larger parts of Cotiviti and our team.
2) - Chris was very effective as a coach. He always ensured we were focused on this quarter's MBIs
- Chris communicates with the team effortlessly
- Chris was very good at setting priorities
- Chris works at a good speed. He developed a newer architecture with a working prototype of the entire system
- Chris has been very effective at managing delivery risk
3) Chris was an excellent coach this quarter; he not only helped me form well-defined intentional goals but also gave me multiple tips on how to achieve those goals. He also kept us in the loop on important news going on in the company.
4) The points of interaction, especially around Hiro have shown your skill and passion to creating the best darned policy execution environment on the face of the planet.  It is exciting to see your progress and passion and look forward to our journey towards using Hiro.
5) Awesome work this quarter. I would like to suggest that you should look out for more opportunities to be started as initiatives/experiments in labs.
6) Your work this quarter seems to be bearing some sort of fruit.
7) Chris has demonstrated taking us to the next level with the lambda architecture.  That said, I think the speed at which he came to conclusions on value short circuits sharing ownership.  This next quarter, I'd recommend finding opportunities to share ownership and victories.
8) While only having the opportunity to work with you for a couple of months, it is clear that you have great organizational skills and focus, as demonstrated by the relative speed you got our new team up and running with GitHub, Pepper, ZenHub, and CoachBot.
9) Chris started additional efforts outside the process. This is something we have struggled with as a team, although it seems necessary in the R&D environment. I would say this added to delivery risk for our other commitments. Chris' skills are grand.

In the future, let's get an MBI/OKR for the new work!
### Productivity
1) You are quickly responsive when I have a question, which is always appreciated.  This has allowed me to become "unblocked" from moving ahead in my tasks (issues) such as getting GitHub going, or has brought me to a new understanding of a process or philosophy which likewise enhances my performance (No Optimism, Fear Rules, Humans suck at estimating time). 
2) Chris did a tremendous amount of work this quarter! His coaching with the Content team was fantastic. I think he helped our productivity through direct execution and productive behaviors regarding the board.  Thank you Chris!

Please keep helping the content team next quarter!
3) Probably too much assigned to him; he should consider re-evaluating his workload and delegating where applicable.
4) - Chris developed a lambda architecture for hiro, that could potentially solve many of the issues which we are facing currently
- He got this architecture to a phase where it's able to run with stubbed out data
- Coach bot was rolled to the rest of the company. He played a crucial role in this
5) Clearly you have been producing like crazy.  Whether it be in releases of Hiro, your new book deal, continued engagement with CoachBot, engagement with AWS / Dave Hsu on cloud strategy, or evaluation of slack / teams, you have been amazingly productive.
6) Chris works on many different fronts.  I'm concerned at times how he balances the work he does with life, but it works for him.  Keep rocking.
7) Momentum on the lambda architecture is growing
8) Chris did a lot of great work in pushing CoachBot out to a wider company audience this quarter.
### Reliability
1) You have been proactive in getting work done and anticipating discussions around collaboration tools, cloud strategy,  and policy execution.  Your discipline around pushing these items forward, especially the Hiro and cloud work will benefit us enormously as we will need both in the coming quarter.
2) Chris kept all of his coaching commitments to me this quarter, as well as his commitments to CoachBot.
3) - Chris was reliable and followed through commitments
- Chris developed a working prototype of the new lambda architecture. This enables us to more productive conversations about how we can leverage that to solve the current problems
4) Chris swapped expectations mid-quarter.  This seems disruptive. 
5) Honestly you were very responsive to our needs as a team - if we needed ZenHub updated, you did it.  You tend to take immediate action rather than put things off till later (in my experience) which is a value I share and which sets a great precedent for all of those who work with you. 
6) I had no issues with Chris' reliability.  He is reliably Chris.
7) Occasionally slow to respond but once you have his attention he solves the problem.
### Contribution
1) Great contributions on many fronts.  I like the Lambda Architecture although it is frought with risk. Can't say enough about supporting the expansion of the coaching and feedback model. It's awesome. 

We need your continued support. Thank you for the positive energy and welcoming attitude to the new team members!
2) Dangerous exploration and failing fast is a great technique, but not for the wind-down quarter of a production system. Consider the consequences of your experimentation and do so with clear purpose.
3) Chris tracks each of the teams to make certain that they're heading in strategically valuable locations; course corrections, when they occur, prove to be immensely useful in getting the team back on track.
4) I feel that you have, as a coach, guided the team well and taught me a lot, both directly (training sessions) and indirectly (observing you do your thing). Your enthusiasm for this team's existence and the warm welcome we received, even if we are not software developers in the classic sense, is much appreciated.   Most of all I feel "psychologically safe" on this team and that has a lot to do with you, and it is one of my most valued attributes.
5) - Chris rolled out coach bot to the rest of the company, that is huge
- Chris developed a new lambda architecture prototype
- Being my coach this quarter, Chris always provided right direction when I was stuck with something. When I was doing some GPU research this quarter, I was spending time to see if we can run the entire reason compiler as a whole with GPUs. Chris suggested that I should try with a smaller example first and see if we can actually leverage GPUs for this scenario. That suggestion led to a conclusion about that research
- When we were being bogged down issues with production regularly, Chris took an initiative on his own to get a new architecture that could solve many of the problems we were facing
6) I am accepting the possibility that I actually do not understand our culture.  Chris appears to have launched onto a path of assuming his implied authority to execute changes that have not been demonstrated to be necessary.
7) At times, it felt like credit was not always given appropriately during the quarter.  This was not intentional, but has an impact in a team that celebrates success.  Try to ensure that everybody involved is able to share in group victories.
8) As mentioned above, you have been making great strides in continuing to enhance Hiro, while pushing forward in many areas including our cloud strategy, employee engagement and collaboration.

## Social advice
### Energy
1) Chris has had a LOT of positive energy this quarter.  Keep it up this next quarter.
2) Great energy levels. 
Chris I don't know which block to add this comment but i need to say this please hire project manager or someone like Gayla who can go through all MBI's and is responsible for keeping track of progress of each issue. It depletes all my energy worrying about updating those issues. And specially when you pinged someone and the other person still could not find time to update their issues, oh god its painful, because it reflects poorly on you. I want to write good programs and not run behind people asking them to do what they should do on their own and with pepper's help.
Reading "triggers book" was not fun because of the same monotonous advices, I understand there was lot of value in what we read, but we could have read something else for this quarter or may be by some other author to bring some diversity and fun. 
3) I can't ding Chris on energy. He had some rough days this quarter and many challenges with his expectations vs. leadership. Despite this, he maintained a supportive attitude and worked with me when we needed to to stay focus and trust. Great quarter for him overall. It was a little expensive though emotionally.

You found some good times to share and garner some assurance. Make sure you keep doing that. It is critical.
4) Chris was my coach this quarter and after coaching meetings, I always felt inspired and energized.
5) My interactions with you have always been positive which does not mean that you don't correct me or disagree with me.  I prefer candor and honesty and you seem to have that in spades.  You know when it is time expound (explaining the philosophy of real agile) as well as when to opt for brevity (pepper agenda) and I enjoy working with you so far.
6) Communication was extremely taxing
7) - I had many productive conversations with Chris this quarter, all of them were productive and knowledgable
- I walked away energized from these conversations, with better understanding and new ideas
- Discussions are quick and productive. I don't hesitate to talk to him if I need something
8) our meetings are always thought provoking and incredible valuable.  Their lack of frequency tends to make them more of an event than I would like them to be.  It seems to take more energy to get into the dialogue than it should but once we get into the conversation, they become much easier.  I feel that these conversations will take less energy as we meet more frequently and as we work collectively to migrate to a common path.
### Improvement
1) This is probably more me and my perspective than anything else but I feel that we are turning a critical corner.  I believe that we have all toiled to the point where we can start to use Hiro and other Labs capabilities to start really driving value.  I think it will be valuable for you and me to discuss this journey that we have been on and continue to go on we become more aligned.
2) It's hard to define improvement for Chris since he sets the pace for the team and is thus usually the measure.  However, he did up his game with the lambda architecture this quarter.
3) ...because I did not know you before! Everything is up from nothing in this case.  I wish I could find a STAR/AR for you - maybe next time.
### Frequency
1) - We met at least once every week, to talk about the progress of personal improvement objectives and other issues when required
- This helped me to progress on the issues by moving in the right direction
2) We should interact more than this.  It is a miss, and it is on me.
3) We met a little less than last quarter. It was due to me, not a limit on Chris' end
4) Chris and I interacted at an expected frequency this quarter.
5) While primarily in the biweekly pepper sessions, we have had the opportunity to converse in Slack, and benefit from various topic-oriented coaching and trainings, All-Hands meetings, etc.  Considering how packed your calendar is, I feel honored!
