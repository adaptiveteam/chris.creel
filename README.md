## Coaching advice
### Skill
1) The way you lead us to the working solution in such a short time is amazing.
2) As this quarter you were no longer facilitating our board meetings, our primary interactions were around slack bot features, hiro/validation, labs-team newscaster and speculator and coaching.  I will leave coaching to the coaching survey.  I jest about the newscaster/speculation -but your communication of all things factual, hopeful, and speculative was very helpful, and as this is part of your role, I am completely satisfied.  You were also very responsive in regards to new bot development and guiding us to appropriate venues for bug report, or helping to unstick blocked/stuck things.  I suppose one might say you are the oil for the engine.  
3) Amazing work with distrubuted HIRO. The help to transition in the new company environment was invaluable.
4) Amazing focus on showcasing the products built by labs 
5) Outstanding understanding of the architecture of developing the solution and helped me to understand the architecture of the solution that to be developed and helped me set the priorities.
6) Chris found a good balance of helping work the technical side of Hiro and returning to his star position of PR for our team.  This seems to have worked well as our team is seeming to find our home.
7) You have solid people and human relations managing skills. You might be a good entrepreneur and/or inspiring company's leader.
### Productivity
1) He asked to learn about the technologies needed and took me through smooth lane of learning those so that I was adopting to use them in a very sophisticated way.
2) Chris is always cranking and is the most productive person on our team.
3) without knowing all of the things with which you were directly involved, from my vantage -with the creation of github_admin and the processes put in place to streamline github access within the organization, and the driving force for some great new bots to streamline our processes, you were quite productive. 
4) Getting the team to stay on course was awesome
5) Chris was incredibly productive this quarter. He was supportive as well in Watsons need to focus and make tradeoffs. It was an amazing quarter.
### Reliability
1) Chris was busy and away with lots of new communication being established with new leadership. He was still very reliable!
2) You were consistently very responsive when people had issues or you were in a position to help them out.
3) He always explained the exact things and with correct dependencies for me to work on the project. He also gave me the freedom to express my thoughts which helped me to go beyond and come with better solutions.
4) Chris is always there.  This is something holds strong at his being and shows it by action.
### Contribution
1) Chris gave up lots of vacation time to help position our team.  This shows his commitment to the team.
2) You helped me to find a position where I can be more productive. This is important for both our team and me as a developer. Thank you.
3) Always enjoy the outcomes of refactored teaming models. Another great quarter for the Labs structure.
4) He helped me in learning different aspects of the team culture and gave me ample time to understand the different technologies which helped me in developing the solutions.
5) Your biggest contribution was your hard work in getting the new Cotiviti to find a place for who we are and what we do. I hope your hard work pays off.

## Social advice
### Energy
1) I will always look forward to talking to him as he helped me to inculcate the attitude to learn new things and most important pointed out my mistakes sometimes and gave me the advice to correct it which has evolved me into a better person.
2) We had very positive interactions this quarter and we often got a lot accomplished in a short time.  I hope that we continue to be able to work together next year in some capacity.
3) You always have a solution to our problems. You are the person we look up on when we are struck/struggling at some point.
4) Conversations with Chris this quarter were great.  He seemed to find a peace about what he had done, what the team had done, and what we were doing.  This seemed to result in peace around the team.  Keep this frame of mind going forward.
5) Our conversations are always targeted and productive. You have a sharp mind and it's always a pleasure talking to you.
6) - Conversations were productive and very knowledgable and lead to actionable items
- During one of the conversations this quarter, we were talking about integrating VPC. When we came across something which we did not understand fully, after discussing with Chris we decided to contact AWS support and that lead to the resolution of the issue.
7) Chris was positive throughout the quarter despite a lot of challenges.  I was pleasantly surprised at his objectivity given the loss of key leadership. He was not a sour grape, which many others were. He was supportive and it was refreshing and needed by the whole team.
### Improvement
1) I want to thank you for the time investment you gave to me this quarter
### Frequency
1) While not always face to face we interacted multiple times per week via slack.
2) We could have met more.  My coaching time was a little weak and got lost in the shuffle. We met enugh though to keep the trains moving.
3) We look forward to meet you more frequently.
4) I always had frequent interactions several times a week with him regarding the tasks which I was working on and also when I was faced with any other problems. Nice Job.
